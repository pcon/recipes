1 package full fat, full sugar, brand name Oreos
1 package full fat, brand name Philadelphia cream cheese at room temperature
1 12oz bag chocolate chips (brand doesn’t matter, but don’t go cheap!)

Crush the Oreos. Doesn’t matter how. I use my blender, but a Ziplock bag and a hammer works just as well.
Mix in the cream cheese. I use my hands. Really get in there! The dough will not be smooth. Don’t worry! The moisture from the cream cheese will soften up the cookie bits.
Form the dough into bitesized balls. Or make’m bigger. I don’t care. 
Freeze or refrigerate them until they’re hard enough to not fall apart in melted chocolate.

Melt the chocolate chips in a double boiler. I use two pots nested together. I ain’t fancy.
Dip the balls into the chocolate and lay them on parchment paper to cool/dry/harden.
Try to not eat all of them before sharing with family and friends!
