# Gluten Free Fried Chicken Sandwich

This is a fairly easy thing to make but it does make a lot of mess and requires some hardware that not everyone will have.

## Additional Stats

* Gluten Free

## Hardware

* Cast iron frying pan _(not 100% required but makes keeping frying temps easier)_ - [Buy](http://amzn.to/1TMyxwy)
* Frying thermometer _(Absolutely required. If you don't have one spend the money and get one)_ - [Buy](http://amzn.to/1SxJ1NP)
* Whisk or some other stirring implement
* Two shallow dishes
* Baking sheet with a wire rack in it _(optional but will make your chicken stay crisper)_

## Software

This recipe is a bit looser than most of my other ones.  I typically eyeball it so the quantities of some of the spices may be a little off.

* Boneless skinless chicken breast (1 lb)
* Buttermilk _(whole milk will work in a pinch)_ (1 cup)
* Gluten-free all-purpose flour (1/2 cup) - [Buy](http://amzn.to/1Mgd0Ku)
* Ranch dressing mix (1 oz / 1 pkg) - [Buy](http://amzn.to/1HEW1yt)
* Salt (1 tbs) _(I prefer Kosher salt)_
* Chili powder (1/2 tbs)
* Black pepper (1 tsp)
* Cayenne pepper (1/2 tsp) _[Optional]_
* Vegetable oil _(Amount depends on size of pan)_

## Preparation

1. If chicken breasts are thick, cut in half
2. Between two sheets of plastic wrap, pound chicken flat until it is roughly 1/8" thick.
  * Optionally if you have thick chicken breasts you can cut them in half long ways and skip this.  However you're chicken peices may be a little weirdly shaped.
3. Mix flour and all seasonings together in a shallow dish.  Wisk to combine evenly.
4. Pour milk into a shallow dish
5. Dredge chicken in the seasoning mixture making sure to get good coverage, Shake off excess mix.
6. Dunk chicken in milk and let excess milk drain
7. Dredge chicken a second time, shake off excess mix
8. Place chicken in a single layer on a plate

## Cooking

1. Pour oil to come about 1/2" side of pan
2. Affix frying thermometer to side of pan
3. Heat oil to 375Â°F
4. Carefully place chicken in oil and fry for 3-4 minutes _(Shortly after placing in pan, wiggle the chicken a little to keep it from sticking to the bottom)_
5. If chicken is not completely submerged flip and cook for an additional 3 minutes
6. Remove chicken from oil and place on cooling rack
7. [Optional] add additional salt right after it comes out of the oil

## Serving

Really? Ok...

1. Put chicken on Gluten free bun
2. Add toppings

## Notes

* If all of your chicken will not fit in the pan, work in batches.  Make sure to let your oil rebound to the correct temperature before adding more chicken
* Placing paper towels between the baking sheet and the cooling rack will help catch any dripping oil
