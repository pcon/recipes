## Additional Stats

## Hardware

## Software

* Chicken (2 breasts)
* Cooked Bacon (1/2 lb)
* Corn (1/2 can)
* Black Beans (1 can)
* Red Bell Pepper (1/2 pepper) (optional)
* Goat Cheese Crumbles (feta will do in a pinch)
* Siracha (2 tbs)
* Honey (2 tbs)
* Ranch Dressing Powder (1 tbs)
* Cajun Seasoning (I prefer Slap Ya Momma)
* Oil (1 tsp)

## Preperation

1. If you chicken is on the thicker side, consider butterflying it to make it thinner and faster to cook
2. Liberally cover chicken with cajun seasoning
3. Rinse black beans and corn
4. Dice the bell pepper
5. Chop the bacon into small pieces

## Cooking

1. Heat your pan on medium-high and add the oil.  Cook your chicken for 3-4 minutes per side until cooked all the way through
2. Once cooled dice chicken into bitesized pieces
3. Combine the chicken, bacon, cheese, beans, corn and peppers into a container and toss to combine

## Sauce

1. Combine Siracha, honey and ranch powder in a bowl
2. Stir until combined

## Serving

* I pre-portion out the mix into containers for each meal and put sauce in a seperate container to mix when ready to eat

## Notes

* The ratios of corn to beans to cheese to bacon to chicken will be up to you.  I mostly eyeball it depending on my mood and availability of ingredients will determine the ratios
